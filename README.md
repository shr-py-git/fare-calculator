FairRoute: Eliminating Travel Fare Scams for Tourists in India


---

🧩 PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Tourists visiting India often face travel fare scams due to a lack of awareness about actual distances between locations. Local transport providers may exploit this information gap by charging inflated fares. This problem is especially prevalent in major cities where tourists rely on taxis, autos, or informal transport services. There is currently no simple, reliable, and easily accessible tool that allows tourists to independently verify the real travel fares between two places. This lack of transparency results in financial exploitation and a loss of trust in local transport systems.
